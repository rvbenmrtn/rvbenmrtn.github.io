I am discretegames, just a guy online who prefers to remain
[discreet](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/discreet-discrete-definitions-examples),
so you won't see a lot of personal info here. You are on [my blog](https://discretegames.github.io/).
All the posts here are written by me about various little or big projects I do,
usually involving computer science and software development.

## [Username](#username)

My username is partly an acronym that encompasses many of my interests:

- Discrete -- Because I like [discrete math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics)
and things were you can be exact.
- G for Games -- I won the [PyWeek 31](https://pyweek.org/31/) game jam with my solo entry
[Python Prison](https://pyweek.org/e/pythonprison/).
- A for Art -- I've drawn and animated [many emotes](https://www.behance.net/discretegames) for Twitch and Discord.
- M for Math -- I made [a Python library for working with hypercomplex numbers](https://pypi.org/project/hypercomplex/).
- E for Engineering -- I've made many
[K'NEX contraptions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-3f_6STTSZk5yoCS3UC1Tw/videos),
including a [4-bit adder](https://youtu.be/1mxZ6jJ6iic).
- S for (Computer) Science -- I [love programming](https://github.com/discretegames?tab=repositories) and
[theoretical computer science](
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/480162150225018891/868254314488016937/Complexity_Classes_v2.png).

## [Logo](#logo)

[My logo][logo] is a
[NAND logic gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate) shaped like a D inside a stylized G:

 <!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

NAND gates are awesome since they can be used to make [entire](https://nandgame.com/),
[functioning](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) computers.
